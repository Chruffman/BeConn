Description - Through the simple, user-friendly interface of BeConn, individuals  from all over the world can connect with the community around them.  The user can choose to join or create events in either a pubic or private environment and
implement BeConn's easy invitation system.
We will build a location based event planner using an online service that allows users to arrange events and
meetings using a map-based GUI.  Users can drag and drop "pins" onto a map and adjust parameters, including meeting type
(private/public), date/time, venue type (outdoor/indoor), etc.  Users can also search for events in their area relevant to their needs or interests.


Vision Statement - To spark activity in communities around the world.


Motivation - Social events in communities are often spread through word of mouth.  Even with things such as Facebook events, organizing group activities can be an extremely difficult and invonvenient task.  The purpose of our webapp is to help
bring together people in a localized community through convenient online interaction.


Risks - Limited development experience with the tools required to accomplish the tasks could lead to unforeseen obstacles.
	Large amount of competition from other social platforms
	None of the teammates have SQL experience
	Styling


Risk Mitigation Plan - We will have to learn as we work on the application and help each other overcome obstacles that may
arise.  We will focus on creating a functional prototype then we will add features and style the application.


Version Control - GitHub


Software Development Methodology - Agile
